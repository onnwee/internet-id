### 3. Secret Rotation Policies

| Secret Category           | Rotation Frequency        | Automation Level                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Database passwords        | Every 90 days             | Fully automated (AWS RDS + Secrets Manager) |
| IPFS API keys             | Every 90 days             | Semi-automated                              |
| NextAuth secrets          | Every 90 days             | Manual with procedures                      |
| OAuth credentials         | Every 180 days            | Manual with procedures                      |
| Private keys (blockchain) | Annually or on compromise | Manual with emergency procedures            |
| Infrastructure keys       | Every 90 days             | Semi-automated                              |

```

**Breakdown:**

- 85 findings: Documentation examples (deliberately showing secret formats)
- 66 findings: Test fixtures (using placeholder values like "test-secret")
- 0 findings: Actual production secrets or credentials

**Validation:**

- ✅ No `.env` files committed to git

**Testing:**

```bash
# Test case: Try to commit a file with API key
echo "api_key=AKIA1234567890123456" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test"

# Result: ❌ BLOCKED by pre-commit hook

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement dynamic secret rotation without restart
- [ ] Add secret usage analytics
- [ ] Integrate with SIEM (Splunk, ELK)
