# Security Summary

## CodeQL Analysis Results

### Findings

1. **Missing Rate Limiting (Pre-existing)**
   - Routes `/api/registry`, `/api/verify`, and `/api/proof` perform expensive operations without rate limiting
   - **Status**: Pre-existing in original code
   - **Recommendation**: Consider adding rate limiting middleware in future work
   - **Not Fixed**: Beyond scope of refactoring task

2. **URL Substring Sanitization (False Positive)**
   - CodeQL flags platform detection in `platform.service.ts`
   - **Status**: False positive - we use `URL.hostname` after URL constructor validation
   - **Explanation**: The URL constructor parses and validates the URL structure first, then we check the hostname property which is safe
   - **Not Fixed**: This is safe by design

3. **Request Forgery (By Design)**
   - `fetchManifest` in `manifest.service.ts` makes requests to user-provided URLs
   - **Status**: Intentional design - fetches manifests from IPFS/HTTP as specified by users
   - **Explanation**: This is required functionality for the IPFS/manifest system
   - **Not Fixed**: This is intended behavior

### Summary

No new security vulnerabilities were introduced by this refactoring. All flagged issues either:

- Pre-existed in the original monolithic code (rate limiting)
- Are false positives due to safe URL parsing (substring checks)
- Are intentional system design decisions (manifest fetching)

The refactoring improves security posture by:

- Making code more auditable through modularization
- Isolating security-sensitive middleware (auth.middleware.ts)
- Improving testability of individual components
