## Acceptance Criteria Status

### ✅ 1. Containerize backend and web services with twelve-factor configuration

3. Docker images pushed to registry
4. SSH deployment to staging server
5. Database migrations executed
6. Test data seeded (optional)
7. Smoke tests validate deployment
8. Automatic rollback if tests fail

### ✅ 3. Implement production deployment workflow

**Workflow Features:**

- Manual trigger only (no auto-deploy)
- Version tagging for deployments
- Pre-deployment validation checks
- Manual approval gate before deployment
- Pre-deployment database backup
- Blue-green deployment (4 instances → 2 instances)
- Post-deployment smoke tests
- Automatic rollback on failure

**Deployment Process:**

1. Initiate deployment via GitHub Actions UI
2. Specify version tag (e.g., v1.0.0)
3. Pre-deployment validation
4. **Manual approval required**
5. Pre-deployment backup created
6. Blue-green deployment begins

## Additional Enhancements

### Docker Scripts

Added npm scripts for easier Docker operations:

```bash
npm run docker:build:api      # Build API image
npm run docker:build:web      # Build web image
npm run docker:build          # Build both images
npm run docker:up:dev         # Start development
npm run docker:up:staging     # Start staging
npm run docker:up:production  # Start production
npm run docker:down           # Stop all services
npm run docker:logs           # View logs
npm run smoke-test           # Run smoke tests
```

### Smoke Test Script

Automated validation script that tests:

- API health endpoint
- API network connectivity
- API registry endpoint
- Metrics endpoints (Prometheus and JSON)
- Public endpoints (contents, verifications)
- Cache metrics (if Redis available)
- Web application accessibility

### Environment Configurations

**Staging Configuration:**

- Smaller resource limits
- Test data seeding enabled

**Production Configuration:**

- 2 replicas per service (scalable to 4)

## Architecture

### Services

1. **nginx**: Reverse proxy with SSL/TLS termination
2. **api**: Express API server (port 3001)
3. **web**: Next.js web application (port 3000)
4. **db**: PostgreSQL 16 with WAL archiving
5. **redis**: Redis 7 cache layer
6. **backup**: Automated database backup service
7. **certbot**: SSL certificate management

### Volumes

- `db_data_staging/production`: PostgreSQL data
- `backup_data_staging/production`: Database backups
- `redis_data_staging/production`: Redis persistence
- `certbot_www/conf/logs`: SSL certificates
- `nginx_logs`: Nginx access and error logs

### Networks

All services communicate via internal Docker network with:

- Service discovery via service names
- No exposed internal ports (except via nginx)
- Isolated database access

## Testing and Validation

### Pre-Deployment Testing

- ✅ API Docker image builds successfully
- ✅ Web Docker image builds successfully (Next.js standalone)
- ✅ Multi-stage builds optimize image size
- ✅ Linting passes (no critical errors)
- ✅ Formatting checks pass
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets detected

### Post-Deployment Testing

- Health check endpoints validated
- Smoke test script created
- Manual testing procedures documented

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

- API: `/api/health`
- Web: `/` (root path)
- Database: `pg_isready`
- Redis: `redis-cli ping`
- Nginx: HTTP status check

### Metrics

- Prometheus-format metrics: `/api/metrics`
- JSON metrics: `/api/metrics/json`
- Cache metrics: `/api/cache/metrics`
- Docker stats for resource monitoring

### Logging

- Structured logging with Pino
- Container logs via Docker
- Nginx access and error logs
- Configurable log levels per environment

## Performance

### Build Optimization

- Multi-stage builds reduce image size
- Layer caching for faster rebuilds
- Standalone Next.js output
- Production dependency pruning

### Runtime Optimization

- Connection pooling (PostgreSQL)
- Redis caching layer
- Nginx reverse proxy caching
- Resource limits prevent overconsumption
- Health checks ensure service availability

## Rollback Strategy

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Scenario                   | Action               | Database Restore | RTO    | RPO           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Service startup failure    | Quick rollback       | No               | 2 min  | 0             |
| API errors (no DB changes) | Quick rollback       | No               | 2 min  | 0             |
| Failed migration           | Full rollback        | Yes              | 10 min | Last backup   |
| Data corruption            | Full rollback + PITR | Yes              | 15 min | Any timestamp |
| Performance issues         | Investigate first    | Maybe            | Varies | Varies        |

### Rollback Procedures

1. **Automatic**: Triggered by failed smoke tests
2. **Manual Quick**: Code-only rollback (< 2 minutes)
3. **Manual Full**: Code + database restore (< 10 minutes)
4. **PITR**: Point-in-time recovery to specific timestamp (< 15 minutes)

## Known Limitations and TODOs

### Security

- [ ] Remove CSP `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` directives (use nonces/hashes)
- [ ] Consider dedicated container registry token for production

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Kubernetes deployment configurations
- [ ] Automated canary deployments
- [ ] A/B testing infrastructure
- [ ] Automated performance regression testing
- [ ] Multi-region deployment support
- [ ] Disaster recovery automation
