# Smart Contract Audit Preparation Checklist

This checklist guides the preparation of ContentRegistry.sol for professional security audit before mainnet deployment.

## Pre-Audit Phase

### 1. Contract Finalization ✅

- [x] All features implemented and tested
- [x] Code review completed by team
- [x] No pending major changes
- [ ] Pin Solidity version to exact release (change `^0.8.20` to `0.8.20`)
- [x] Remove debug code and console.log statements (none present)
- [x] Optimize gas usage
- [ ] Add comprehensive NatSpec documentation

**Status**: Ready with minor improvements needed

### 2. Documentation Preparation ✅

- [x] Contract purpose clearly documented (README.md)
- [x] Function documentation (inline comments)
- [ ] Add NatSpec (@notice, @dev, @param, @return)
- [x] Architecture diagrams (flow documented in README)
- [x] Integration documentation
- [x] Known limitations documented
- [x] Deployment process documented

**Files to Provide**:
- [x] README.md
- [x] contracts/ContentRegistry.sol
- [x] hardhat.config.ts
- [x] test/ContentRegistry.ts
- [x] docs/SMART_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md (automated analysis)

### 3. Test Coverage Enhancement 🔄

Current: Basic tests passing (264 tests total for entire project)

**Smart Contract Tests Needed**:
- [x] Basic registration and retrieval
- [ ] Access control tests (non-creator attempts)
- [ ] Duplicate registration prevention
- [ ] Platform binding edge cases
- [ ] Event emission verification
- [ ] Gas consumption benchmarks
- [ ] Boundary condition tests
- [ ] Integration tests with deployment

**Test Coverage Goal**: >90% line coverage for ContentRegistry.sol

**Action Items**:
```bash
# Measure current coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Add tests for edge cases
- Test non-creator trying to updateManifest
- Test non-creator trying to revoke
- Test non-creator trying to bindPlatform
- Test binding same platform twice
- Test resolving non-existent platform binding
- Verify all events are emitted with correct parameters
```

### 4. Automated Security Analysis ✅

- [x] Slither analysis completed
- [x] Findings documented and reviewed
- [ ] Mythril analysis (optional - had dependency conflicts)
- [ ] Securify analysis (optional - not yet run)
- [x] All critical/high findings addressed
- [x] Medium/low findings evaluated and documented

**Slither Results**: 0 critical, 0 high, 1 medium (false positive), 4 low (accepted)

### 5. Code Quality ✅

- [x] ESLint passing
- [x] Prettier formatting applied
- [x] CI/CD pipeline green
- [x] No compiler warnings
- [x] Optimizer settings documented (200 runs)
- [x] License specified (MIT)

## Audit Package Preparation

### 6. Prepare Audit Package 📦

**Required Files**:

```
audit-package/
├── README.md                           # Project overview
├── AUDIT_SCOPE.md                      # Scope and focus areas
├── contracts/
│   └── ContentRegistry.sol             # Contract to audit
├── test/
│   └── ContentRegistry.ts              # Test suite
├── docs/
│   ├── SMART_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md         # Automated analysis results
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md                 # System architecture
│   └── ASSUMPTIONS.md                  # Design assumptions
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.ts                       # Deployment script
├── hardhat.config.ts                   # Build configuration
├── package.json                        # Dependencies
└── deployed/                           # Testnet deployment info
    └── base-sepolia.json
```

### 7. Scope Definition 📋

Create AUDIT_SCOPE.md with:

- [ ] Contract to audit: ContentRegistry.sol
- [ ] Out of scope: Test files, deployment scripts (unless security critical)
- [ ] Focus areas:
  - [ ] Access control mechanisms
  - [ ] State management integrity
  - [ ] Event emission correctness
  - [ ] Gas optimization opportunities
  - [ ] Economic security (incentives, game theory)
  - [ ] Integration security
- [ ] Known limitations:
  - [ ] No pause mechanism (by design)
  - [ ] No upgrade mechanism (by design)
  - [ ] Unbounded array for platform bindings
  - [ ] No maximum binding limit
- [ ] Assumptions:
  - [ ] Creators act honestly with their own content
  - [ ] Platform IDs are unique per platform
  - [ ] Content hashes are computed correctly off-chain
  - [ ] No critical security dependency on exact timestamps

### 8. Test Environment 🧪

- [x] Hardhat development environment
- [x] Deployed to testnet (Base Sepolia)
- [ ] Provide testnet contract address
- [ ] Provide testnet RPC access (if needed)
- [ ] Document test accounts/keys for audit team
- [ ] Ensure sufficient testnet funds for testing

**Testnet Info**:
```
Network: Base Sepolia
RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
Contract: [To be deployed for audit]
Etherscan: https://sepolia.basescan.org
```
