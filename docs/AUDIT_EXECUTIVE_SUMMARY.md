## Security Audit Readiness Assessment

| Criterion          | Status        | Notes                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Contract finalized | ✅ Complete   | All features implemented and tested   |
| Automated analysis | ✅ Complete   | Slither analysis passed               |
| Documentation      | ✅ Complete   | NatSpec, design docs, security policy |
| Test coverage      | ✅ Complete   | Comprehensive test suite (12 tests)   |
| Code review        | ✅ Complete   | Internal review completed             |
| CodeQL scan        | ✅ Complete   | 0 security alerts                     |
| Known issues       | ✅ Documented | All findings analyzed and addressed   |

## Security Strengths

1. **Simple Design**: Minimal attack surface, easy to audit
2. **No External Calls**: No reentrancy risk
3. **Access Control**: Proper use of `onlyCreator` modifier
4. **Integer Safety**: Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection
5. **Gas Optimized**: Uses `calldata` for strings
6. **Event Driven**: All state changes emit events
7. **Immutable**: No admin privileges or upgrade mechanisms

## Known Limitations

1. **No Pause Mechanism**: By design - prioritizes decentralization
2. **No Upgrade Path**: By design - immutable registry
3. **Unbounded Array**: `hashToPlatformKeys` could grow large (acceptable for reads)
4. **Timestamp Dependency**: Used only for existence checks (low risk)

## Professional Audit Recommendations

### Recommended Audit Firms

1. **Trail of Bits** - Best for complex contracts, formal verification
2. **OpenZeppelin** - Strong reputation, excellent documentation
3. **Consensys Diligence** - Comprehensive methodology
4. **Certik** - Fast turnaround, good for simpler contracts
5. **Halborn** - Strong technical team, competitive pricing

### Audit Scope

**In Scope**:

- ContentRegistry.sol (primary focus)
- Deployment scripts (review for security)
- Test suite (coverage verification)
- Integration patterns (off-chain verification)

**Out of Scope**:

- Web UI (separate security review)
- API endpoints (already secured and tested)
- IPFS infrastructure (external dependency)

### Timeline and Budget

| Phase                | Duration      | Cost Estimate         |
