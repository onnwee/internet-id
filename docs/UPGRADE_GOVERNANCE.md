# ContentRegistry Upgrade Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance procedures for upgrading the ContentRegistry smart contract. It defines who can upgrade, when upgrades can occur, and the approval process required.

## Governance Models

### Current Model: Single Owner (Development Phase)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Development/Testing Only

**Configuration**:

- Single EOA (Externally Owned Account) owns the proxy
- Owner can upgrade immediately without additional approval
- Suitable for rapid iteration during development

**Risks**:

- Single point of failure
- No review period
- Immediate execution

**When to Use**:

- Local testing
- Testnet deployments
- Early development phase

### Recommended Model: Multisig (Production)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Recommended for Production

**Configuration**:

- Gnosis Safe multisig wallet owns the proxy
- Requires M-of-N signatures (e.g., 3-of-5)
- Distributed control among trusted parties

**Setup**:

```
1. Deploy Gnosis Safe with 5 signers
2. Set threshold to 3 signatures
3. Transfer proxy ownership to Safe
4. Document all signer identities
```

**Signers Should Be**:

- Core team members (2-3)
- Security auditors (1)
- Community representatives (1-2)
- Geographically distributed
- Available 24/7 for emergencies

**Upgrade Process**:

1. Proposer creates upgrade transaction in Safe
2. Signers review implementation code
3. Minimum 3 signatures collected
4. Transaction executed on-chain

**Advantages**:

- Distributed trust
- No single point of failure
- Transparent on-chain record
- Protection against compromised keys

**Tools**:

- [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.global/)
- [Safe Transaction Service API](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-api)

### Advanced Model: DAO + Timelock (Long-term)

**Status**: üîÆ Future Enhancement

**Configuration**:

```
Community Members
    ‚Üì
Voting (On-chain)
    ‚Üì
Governor Contract
    ‚Üì
Timelock (48h delay)
    ‚Üì
Proxy Upgrade
```

**Components**:

1. **Governor Contract** (OpenZeppelin Governor)
   - Receives proposals
   - Manages voting
   - Executes approved proposals

2. **Timelock Contract** (OpenZeppelin TimelockController)
   - Enforces delay period (e.g., 48 hours)
   - Allows cancellation during delay
   - Provides transparency window

3. **Governance Token** (Optional)
   - Voting power based on token holdings
   - Or: 1 address = 1 vote

**Upgrade Process**:

1. Anyone proposes upgrade (with deposit)
2. Community votes (7-day period)
3. If approved, queued in timelock
4. 48-hour delay for review
5. Anyone can execute after delay

**Advantages**:

- Maximum decentralization
- Community involvement
- Transparent review period
- Cancel mechanism for issues

**Disadvantages**:

- Slower process
- Higher gas costs
- Complexity
- Requires active community

**When to Use**:

- Mature project with active community
- When decentralization is priority
- After initial stability period

## Upgrade Authorization Matrix

| Environment | Owner           | Approval       | Timelock  | Purpose             |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| Localhost   | Dev EOA         | None           | No        | Testing             |
| Testnet     | Dev EOA         | Team Review    | No        | Integration Testing |
| Staging     | Multisig 2-of-3 | Code Review    | No        | Pre-production      |
| Production  | Multisig 3-of-5 | Audit + Review | Optional  | Live System         |
| Long-term   | DAO + Timelock  | Community Vote | Yes (48h) | Decentralized       |

## Upgrade Approval Process

### 1. Proposal Phase

**Requirements**:

- [ ] Simulation successful
- [ ] Testnet deployment successful
- [ ] Gas benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] No breaking changes (unless documented)

**Testing Period**:

- Testnet: Minimum 7 days
- Production: After testnet validation

### 4. Approval Phase

3. Request signatures from required parties
4. Each signer reviews:
   - Implementation code
   - Test results

- [ ] Team available for support

**Execution**:

```bash
# Verify everything is ready
npm run build
npm test

# Execute upgrade
npx hardhat run scripts/upgrade-to-v2.ts --network <network>

# Post-execution verification
# - Check version
# - Test core functions
# - Monitor error logs
```

**Post-Execution**:

- [ ] Verify upgrade successful
- [ ] Test all critical functions
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Announce completion

## Emergency Upgrade Procedures

### When to Use Emergency Process

- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Contract functionality broken
- User funds at risk
- Exploit actively occurring

### Emergency Multisig Process

**Fast Track Requirements**:

1. Document the emergency clearly
2. Notify all signers immediately
3. Expedite review (4-hour window)
4. Collect required signatures
5. Execute upgrade
6. Post-incident report

**Communication**:

```
Emergency Alert Template:

URGENT: Critical Upgrade Required

Issue: [Description]
Severity: [Critical/High]
Impact: [What's affected]
Timeline: [How urgent]
Action: [What signers need to do]
Details: [Link to full report]
```

### Emergency DAO Process

**Fast Track (if implemented)**:

1. Emergency proposal flagged
2. Shortened voting period (24 hours)
3. Lower quorum (5% instead of 10%)
4. Reduced timelock (4 hours instead of 48h)
5. Guardian can execute immediately if votes not reached

## Security Considerations

### Owner Key Management

**Best Practices**:

- Use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- Store keys in multiple secure locations
- Use key management systems (e.g., Fireblocks)
- Regular key rotation procedures
- Document key holders

**For Multisig**:

- Each signer uses separate hardware wallet
- Geographic distribution
- Different physical locations
- Documented recovery procedures

### Monitoring and Alerts

**What to Monitor**:

- Upgrade transactions
- Owner changes
- Failed transactions
- Unusual patterns
- Implementation address changes

**Alert Channels**:

- Discord notifications
- Email alerts
- SMS for critical events
- Status page updates

**Tools**:

- OpenZeppelin Defender
- Tenderly Alerts
- Custom monitoring scripts

## Governance Evolution Path

### Phase 1: Development (Current)

```
Single EOA ‚Üí Fast iteration
```

**Duration**: During development
**Goal**: Rapid testing and iteration

### Phase 2: Initial Launch

```
Multisig 3-of-5 ‚Üí Distributed control
```

**Duration**: First 6 months after launch
**Goal**: Stable, secure upgrades

### Phase 3: Community Growth

```
Multisig + Community Feedback ‚Üí Hybrid governance
```

**Duration**: 6-12 months post-launch
**Goal**: Incorporate community input

### Phase 4: Decentralization

```
DAO + Timelock ‚Üí Full decentralization
```

**Duration**: 12+ months post-launch
**Goal**: Community-driven governance

## Governance Parameters

### Upgrade Frequency

**Recommended Limits**:

- Maximum: 1 upgrade per 30 days
- Minimum delay between upgrades: 14 days
- Exception: Emergency security fixes

**Reasoning**:

- Allows community to adapt
- Reduces upgrade fatigue
- Maintains stability
- Builds trust

### Review Periods

| Upgrade Type             | Review Period | Approval               |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Minor (bug fixes)        | 3 days        | 2-of-3 signers         |
| Standard (new features)  | 7 days        | 3-of-5 signers         |
| Major (breaking changes) | 14 days       | 4-of-5 signers + audit |
| Emergency                | 4 hours       | 3-of-5 signers         |

### Freeze Period (Recommended)

**Pre-v1.0 Launch**:

- 30-day freeze period before v1.0
