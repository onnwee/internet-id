# Security Summary - Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive rate limiting to all API endpoints to protect against abuse, DDoS attacks, and resource exhaustion.

## Security Vulnerabilities Discovered

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Introduced by This PR)
The CodeQL security scan identified 2 pre-existing vulnerabilities in `scripts/api.ts`:

1. **Path Injection (js/path-injection)** at line 63
   - Issue: User-provided values influence file paths
   - Status: **Pre-existing** - Not introduced by rate limiting changes
   - Recommendation: Add path validation in future PR

2. **Request Forgery (js/request-forgery)** at line 68
   - Issue: URL depends on user-controlled data
   - Status: **Pre-existing** - Not introduced by rate limiting changes
   - Recommendation: Add URL validation in future PR

### New Code Security Analysis
The rate limiting implementation introduces:
- ✅ No new security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Protection against DDoS attacks via rate limiting
- ✅ Secure Redis connection handling with fallback
- ✅ No sensitive data leakage in error responses
- ✅ Proper separation of exempt API keys

## Rate Limiting Security Features

### Abuse Prevention
- **Tiered rate limits**: Different limits for different endpoint categories
- **IP-based tracking**: Prevents single-IP abuse
- **429 responses**: Standard HTTP response for rate limiting
- **Retry-After headers**: Informs clients when to retry

### Authenticated Exemptions
- Optional `RATE_LIMIT_EXEMPT_API_KEY` for trusted services
- Secure key checking via headers
- No key leakage in logs or responses

### Monitoring & Logging
- Rate limit hit logging with IP and path
- Timestamp recording for abuse pattern analysis
- No sensitive data in logs

## Recommendations

### For This PR
✅ All security requirements met:
- Rate limiting protects against abuse
- No new vulnerabilities introduced
- Proper error handling and logging
- Secure configuration via environment variables

### For Future PRs
1. Address pre-existing path injection in `scripts/api.ts` line 63
2. Address pre-existing request forgery in `scripts/api.ts` line 68
3. Consider adding input validation middleware
4. Implement security headers (CORS, CSP, etc.)

## Conclusion
This rate limiting implementation significantly improves the security posture of the API by preventing abuse and resource exhaustion attacks. No new security vulnerabilities were introduced, and the implementation follows security best practices.
